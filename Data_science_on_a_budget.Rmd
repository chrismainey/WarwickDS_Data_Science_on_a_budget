# NHS Overview

__UK's large, public-funded, healthcare system__

+ Covers primary care (GP), secondary care (hospital), community and mental health services, tertiary care (regional specialisms, e.g. transplant)
+ Although there is much national co-operation, it is a network of separate competing organisations

--

__Data Science work can be found in lots of areas:__
+ Trust business reporting, and information teams
+ Finance and planning teams
+ Clinical research, sometimes in partnership
+ Clinical sciences, e.g. imaging, genomic
+ Interested lone workers, e.g. doctors with interest

---

# Univesity Hospitals Birmingham NHS FT

+ One of the largest Trust's in UK
+ Four hospitals, QE, Heartlands, Good Hope, Solihull
+ Regional specialist services center
+ Strong clinical research presence, including partnerships with HDR-UK, Turing Institute, Microsoft etc.

--

__Informatics:__
+ Large department, merger of four hospitals, skills differential.
+ SQL Server development, analysis and dashboards is major part.
+ Data engineering is major part of job.
+ Funding is tight and hard to justify new projects, given workload.

# What is our work like?

+ Building models on national hospital data, mortality, readmissions, LOS etc.

--

+ Not 'big data', but large, relational data (~60 million pa, 100+ data items)

--

+ We had used SAS for many years, but it's expensive.

--

+ I had PhD work funded, and chose to use `R`, led to devleoping new methods.

--

+ Working to 'productions' our modelling process in `R`, improve automation etc.

--

+ Adopted tools like Git and building R packages, looking at Docker etc., but not 'supported.'

--

+ I have to justify increase in profit, or saving on time spent to frame what we do.

--

+ I run R training courses and R-usergroup to promote it.
---

# Set up

+ Bog-standard Windows desktop.

--

+ Fight for more RAM, although over charged!

--

+ Important to note, cloud providers are not yet trusted. Compute is based on our own physical servers.

--

+ Desktops are constrained in RAM, disk and CPU, so we learnt to be efficient.

--

+ Couldn't get funding for RStudio professional or other solutions, so eventually set up our own.

--

+ Acquired a piece of a 'development' server and put Linux VM on it, now run RStudio server.

--

+ Again, not supported by our Trust, but we have to manage locally.


---

# Take aways

+ There is plenty of Data Science in the NHS

+ You have to fight for it

+ Need to sell the benefits to anyone who might be able to fund.

+ Even without funding, there is loads you can do.

+ Demonstrate benefit to make your case!

+ Engage with the community, e.g. NHS-R community, Twitter, third sector

+ Be an Evangelist!  Train others, publish blogs/articles, be a mentor.
